            Hi! I'm a co-founder of Coursera, and developed the initial platform for Stanford's online machine learning and databases classes that started all this. I want to give everyone access to the best professors in the best universities in the world, for free. I love teaching, and used to spend hours at home fiddling with tablets and video editing to figure out how to make better online courses. In my spare time, I also run the Stanford AI Lab, build large scale brain simulations, and practice sucking at ping pong.

            Hi, I'm Daphne. I'm a 3rd generation PhD, so it was expected that I would go to a good college. (My parents would likely have disowned me otherwise.) I was privileged to have the opportunity, and am passionate about making that available to others. I've been involved in teaching efforts at Stanford throughout my time as a faculty member, but now am committed to making great education available not just to those students lucky enough to attend Stanford, but to everyone around the world. Education should be a right, not a privilege, and I believe Coursera is a way to make that happen.
