I spent two years trying out novel ideas about how best I could develop a neutral yet collaborative platform in order to foster an enhanced learning experience to every learner in the African continent. Back then, I would obsess about anything that I felt would enable me to come up with such a great solution that I felt was inspired by a striking and untold essentiality of fully realizing a non-authoritative and bi-directional exchange of knowledge in our institutions and our society at large. And now all this endless endeavor has brought about this platform through which, we believe, every participant will enormously and positively contribute to a collective body of knowledge. And yet the journey has only begun, not only because learning is lifelong, but also it is entirely about learning how to learn learning itself as an unending and holistic process.</p>
                        <p>I also tend to enjoy joining up a supportive circle of friends with whom I usually go play the pool game around Cape Town only when I'm taking some time off working on TutorPlus. Lastly, I hold an Honors Degree in Computer from the National University of Science and Technology, Zimbabwe. And recently, I took a leave from my studies (Mcom in Information Systems) at the University of Cape Town so I could focus more on bringing about this platform into the hands of its intended lifelong learner. I, professionally, work as a Web Developer since 2006 and am based here in Cape Town, South Africa. And outside my professional work, I enjoy studying Psychology, Sociology, and Philosophy of Mind, among many other disciplines that interest me.</p>
