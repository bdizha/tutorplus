          <h2>The classroom and the World Wide Web</h2>
          Modes of learning have changed dramatically over the past two decades - our sources of information, the ways we exchange and interact with information, how information informs and shapes us. But our schools - how we teach, where we teach, whom we teach, who teaches, who administers, and who services - have changed mostly around the edges. The fundamental aspects of learning institutions remain remarkably familiar and have done so for something like two hundred years or more.
        </div>
        <div class="section-block">
          If we are going to imagine new learning institutions that are not based on the contiguity of time and place - virtual institutions - we have to ask, what are those institutions and what work do they perform? What does a virtual learning institution look like, who supports it, what does it do? We know that informal learning happens, constantly and in many ways, because of the collaborative opportunities offered by social networking sites, wikis, blogs, and many other interactive digital sources.
        </div>
        <div class="section-block">
          Digital technologies increasingly enable and encourage social networking and interactive, collaborative engagements, including those implicating and impacting learning. Digital technologies have dramatically encouraged self-learning. Web interfaces have made for less hierarchical and more horizontal modes of access. The web has also facilitated the proliferation of information, from the inane and banal to the esoteric and profound, from the patently false, and misleading to the compelling, important, (potentially) life-enhancing and life-saving.
        </div>
        <div class="section-block">
          What are the implications of this dual horizontality - of access and contribution - for learning, then? It is to that question we suggest the following five principles of learning.
        </div>

          <h2>Self-learning</h2>
          <div class="section-block">
            Self-learning has bloomed; discovering online possibilities is a skill now developed from early childhood through advanced adult life. Even online reading, Alan Lie reminds us, has become collaborative, interactive, nonlinear, and relational, engaging multiple voices. we browse, scan, connect in mid-paragraph if not mid-sentence to related material, look up information relevant of related to what we are reading.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section-block">
          <h2>Horizontal structures</h2>
          Relatedly, an increasingly horizontal structure of learning puts pressure on how learning institutions—schools, colleges, universities, and their surrounding support apparatuses—enable learning. Institutional education has tended to be authoritative, top-down, standardized, and predicated on individuated assessment measured on standard tests. Increasingly today, work regimes involve collaboration with colleagues in teams. Multitasking and overlapping but not discrete strengths and skills reinforce capacities to work around problems, work out solutions, and work together to complete projects. Given the range and volume of information available and the ubiquity of access to information sources and resources, learning strategy shifts from a focus on information as such to judgment concerning reliable information, from memorizing information to how to find reliable sources. In short, from learning that to learning how, from content to process.
        </div>
        <div class="section-block">
          <h2>From presumed authority to collective credibility</h2>
          <div class="section-block">
            Learning is shifting from issues of authoritativeness to issues of credibility. A major part of the future of learning is in developing methods, often communal, for distinguishing good knowledge sources from those that are questionable. Increasingly, learning is about how to make wise choices - epistemologically, methodologically, concerning productive collaborative partnerships to broach complex challenges and problems. Learning increasingly concerns not only how to resolve issues regarding
            information architecture, inter-operability and compatibility, scalability and sustainability, but also how to address ethical dilemmas. It concerns, in addition, issues of judgment in resolving tensions between different points of view in increasingly interdisciplinary environments. We find ourselves increasingly being moved to interdisciplinary and collaborative knowledge-creating and learning environments in order to address objects of analysis and research problems that are multidimensional
            and complex, and the resolution of which cannot be fashioned by any single discipline. Knowledge formation and learning today thus pose more acute challenges of trust. If older, more traditional learning environments were about trusting knowledge authorities or certified experts, that model can no longer withstand the growing complexities—the relational constitution of knowledge domains and the problems they pose.

        <div class="section-block">
          <h2>Networked learning</h2>
          Socially networked collaborative learning extends some of the most established practices, virtues, and dispositional habits of individualized learning. These include taking turns in speaking, posing questions, listening to and hearing others out. Networked learning, however, goes beyond these conversational rules to include correcting others, being open to being corrected oneself, and working together to fashion workarounds when straightforward solutions to problems or learning challenges are not forthcoming. It is not that individualized learning cannot end up encouraging such habits and practices. But they are not natural to individual learning, which leans on a social framework that stresses competition and hierarchy rather than cooperation, partnering, and mediation. If individualized learning is chained to a social vision prompted by “prisoner dilemma” rationality in which one cooperates only if it maximizes narrow self-interest, networked learning is committed to a vision of the social stressing cooperation, interactivity, mutuality, and social engagement for their own sakes and for the powerful productivity to which it more often than not leads. The power of ten working interactively will almost invariably outstrip the power of one looking to beat out the other nine.
        </div>
        <div class="section-block">
          <h2>Learning as connectivity and interactivity</h2>
          <div class="section-block">
            The connectivities and interactivities made possible by digitally enabled social networking in its best outcomes produce learning ensembles in which the members both support and sustain, elicit from and expand on each other’s learning inputs, contributions, and products. Challenges are not simply individually faced frustrations, Promethean mountains to climb alone, but mutually shared, to be redefined, solved, resolved, or worked around together. An application such as Live Mesh allows one to unite and synchronize one’s entire range of devices and applications into a seamless web of interactivity. It enables instantaneous fileand data-sharing with other users with whom the user is remotely connected, thus allowing at least potentially for seamless and more or less instant communication across work and recreational environments. Our technological architecture thus is fast making net-working—in contrast with isolated, individualized working the default. Slower to adapt, the organzational architecture of our educational institutions and pedagogical delivery are just starting to catch on and catch up.
