                    Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is a new learning paradigm that seeks to bring learning agents to collaborate on their learning activities with the support of a computer as a neutral and objective medium. This presupposes collective intentionality among various participants when they jointly work toward achieving a mutual goal collaboratively.
