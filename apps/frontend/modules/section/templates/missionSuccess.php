            <h2>Setting the stage for CSCL</h2>
            We've envisioned a future of Higher Education learning that is mostly composed of collaborative activities. In the education discipline at large this new paradigm of learning is collectively known as Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). TutorPlus is such a platform to bring about all the empirical and perceived benefits of Collaborative Learning Technologies (CLTs).
