("Personal Information" is defined below.)

In addition, please note that your education records are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA") to the extent FERPA applies.

We may provide your Postings to students who later enroll in the same classes as you, within the context of the forums, the courseware or otherwise.

                Our goal is to provide current and future visitors with the best possible educational experience.

We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy, those publications or public disclosures will not include Personal Information.
