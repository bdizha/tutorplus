                    <h2>Lifelong learning as both the ends and the means of living</h2>
                    It has become obvious that from the point of view of participatory learning there is no finality. Learning is lifelong. It is lifelong not simply in the Socratic sense of it taking that long to realize that the more one knows the more one realizes how little one knows. It is lifelong in the sense also , perhaps anti-Platonically, that the increasingly rapid changes in the world's makeup mean that we must necessarily learn anew, redefining ourselves in the process to face up to the challenges of novel conditions as we bear with us the  lessons of adaptability, of applying lessons to unprecedented situations and challenges. It is not just that economic prospects demand it; increasingly "our" sociality and culture now do, too.

                    It remains an open question still whether connected, open source, interactive , networked, horizontal, lifelong learning will have a transformative epistemological impact on what we learn at our education institutions. But what is certain is that that the pedagogical means and ends have radically changed how we know how we know. It is with this fundamental footing that we turn next and discuss the intricacies of a learning culture.

                    <h2>A learning culture</h2>
                    As always been the case, every generation seeks to redefine itself in a natural pursuit to further exploit its full potential on the part of its individual and collective significance as a dominant species upon all creations. And on the one hand, historically, this natural and dispositional tendency has successfully created an objective reality and emergent meaning from which every subjective individual would rely on for unlimited sense of belonging and mutual support. Yet, on the other profound hand, learning seems to be an indispensable unifying process through which we are all systematically drawn much closer to a mutual grounding that then further facilitates our ever needed social, economical and cultural cohesion that we invariably and sorely depend upon as the dominant species.

                <div class="section-block">
                    This unending cyclic and collective endeavor has some remarkable capabilities to elevate the most hightened values of each constituting individual by affording us a much more predictable environment through which our myriad and distinct interests are fully realized. It appears that only through learning that an individual is able to meet and satisfy the needs of their culture and the reverse is also true.
