        <h2>About TutorPlus</h2>
        TutorPlus is a not-for-profit organization that helps the academic community use educational technologies to preserve the scholarly record and to advance research and learning in the Higher Education sector in sustainable ways. TutorPlus provides a collaborative learning platform that enables the academic community to fully engage its learners and instructors together in their discourse through a neutral and objective platform which is essential for collaborative and participatory learning.

      <div class="section-block">
        We've envisioned a future of Higher Education learning that is mostly composed of collaborative activities. In the education discipline at large this new paradigm of learning is collectively known as Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). TutorPlus is such a platform to bring about all the empirical and perceived benefits of collaborative learning.

        <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
        <div class="section-block">
          We're concerned to conjecture about the character of learning institutions and how they change, how they change those who belong to them, and how people can work together to change them. Our primary focus is Higher Education (HE). It is daunting to think that universities have existed in the developing countries since medieval times and in forms remarkably similar to the universities that exist today. Will they endure for hundreds of years more even as learning increasingly happens virtually, globally, and collaboratively? It is our hope that thinking about the potential of new ways of knowing might inspire the revitalization of those institutions of advanced formal learning.

            The poem "Lifelong learning" by B Matuku is a source of inspiration and a foundation of our efforts in pursuing the strategic development and adoption of educational technologies.

            As we set out to make an impact in our educational territories
            the adventure is completely unknown, full of curves, uphills,
            road blocks, side-liners, well wishers, sabotaging and creativity.

            We acknowledge learning as transformative, unsurprisingly
            social, contextual, and lifelong.

            We can only make it happen through friendly, collaborative and flexible means.
          </div>  
          <div class="poem-body">When we look
            back reminiscingly in the near future will do so with warm
            smiles on our faces and observable satisfaction in our eyes
            in our new knowing of the journey we started can only never
            stop, but continue to making every learning experience an
            invaluable one. 
          </div>
          <div class="poem-body">
            Learning is lifelong. The increasingly rapid changes in the world's makeup mean that we must
            necessarily  learn anew, acquiring new knowledge to face up to the challenges of novel conditions as we
            bear with us the lessons of adaptability, of applying lessons to unprecedented situations and challenges.
