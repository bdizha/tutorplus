    heading: 'Open Source Education Software Unveiled by Google ITProPortal.com (09/13/12) Adario Strange '
    blurb: 'Google has released Course Builder, open source software for creating online education courses. Google says Course Builder does not require high-level programming skills and should be accessible to anyone with the ability to build and maintain their own Web site. "The Course Builder open source project is an experimental early step for us in the world of online education," says Google research director Peter Norvig. "It is a snapshot of an approach we found useful and an indication of our future direction." Norvig says Google researchers plan to directly interact with Course Builder users via Google Hangouts over the next two weeks. A support site has been launched, and the free software download has already received its first update. Google also is offering the Course Builder Checklist as a primer on how to get started and what to expect. "We hope to continue development along these lines, but we wanted to make this limited code base available now, to see what early adopters will do with it, and to explore the future of learning technology," Norvig says.'

Our founding fathers knew that maintaining a democracy is challenging. The purpose here is to remind and highlight the need for government transparency and accountability and to suggest the need for corporate reforms. In an ideal world simply by returning to Constitutional law. The intention of our Constitution, was to provide Liberty and Justice for all.\n\nIt appears that We The People, Risk Loss of Liberty, if we do not step up and pull our weight."

    description: 'CS50 is Harvard University''s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. Both on campus and off, CS50 draws quite the spectrum of students, including "those less comfortable," "those more comfortable," and those somewhere in between. However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you, in Week 11, end up relative to yourself in Week 0.'

To start with business information systems is a discipline like any other implying it has certain values and principles that govern it. You would be wondering what these values are and defines them.

    title: 'How to Take CS50x'
    AssessmentType: AssessmentType_1
    description: "To take CS50x, then, simply start working your way through Week 0 through Week 11. For each week:\r\n\r\nWatch the week's lecture(s). Do take advantage of any questions that appear as you watch. Atop each video is a number that indicates how many questions await your attention; click that number to answer. Consider those questions opportunities to reinforce the week's material. You won't be graded on your answers, so you're welcome to try answering them as many times as you'd like.\r\nWatch one of the week's sections: Nate's if you consider yourself among \"those less comfortable\" or Rob's if you consider yourself among \"those more comfortable.\" If you consider yourself \"somewhere in between,\" you're welcome to watch either or both!\r\nWatch the week's shorts in order to dive into some topics more deeply.\r\nRead the \"specification\" for the week's problem set, watch Zamyla's walkthrough, and then dive into the problem set itself by following the specification's instructions. Note that the \"standard editions\" of some problem sets are accompanied by \"Hacker Editions,\" which are entirely optional. To receive an honor code certificate from HarvardX, you must submit the standard editions of problem sets.\r\nSubmit the problem set per its directions.\r\nIn addition to problem sets, the course also has two quizzes, each of which you must take via edX's website anytime after 15 January 2013 and before 15 April 2013. And the course also has a final project. More details to come!\r\n\r\nOf course, if you do not wish to receive an honor code certificate from HarvardX, you're welcome to take CS50x however you'd like! All of CS50's content will remain available at CS50.tv as OpenCourseWare after 15 April 2013, so not to worry if you don't get through it in time!"
